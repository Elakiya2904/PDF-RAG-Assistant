# PDF-RAG-Assistant
PDF RAG Assistant is a lightweight system that lets users upload a PDF and ask questions about its content. It extracts text, splits it into chunks, generates local embeddings, and uses FAISS for fast retrieval. Relevant chunks are sent to an LLM (FLAN-T5) to produce accurate, context-aware answers.
